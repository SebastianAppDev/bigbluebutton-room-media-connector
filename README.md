# BigBlueButton Room Media Connector

This software system is used to connect media devices inside a room to a BigBlueButton meeting.
This allows to streamline the experience of online users by capturing the best media devices of the room (microphones, cameras).
It also improves the experience for the in-site audience, by displaying the most relevant content, given the available displays.
